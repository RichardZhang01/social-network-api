## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to utilize what I've learned about noSQL, specifically MongoDB, to create a backend application that can implement all CRUD functionality. 
- I built this project to better understand noSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, and how non-relational databases differ from relational databases.
- This project aims to create the back-end for an application that interacts with a database through Insomnia.
- Through this project, I learned more about noSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, routing, seeding of MongoDB data, and the data structure that non-relational databases provide.

## <a id="installation"></a>Installation

**Note**: This application requires the use of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

To install this project, you first need to clone this repo. To install dependencies, open in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and in the terminal run: 

    npm install 

Alternatively, you can navigate to the application's installation location in [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (or similar command-line tool) and do the same.

You can seed the database using test data I created by opening the terminal and running:

    npm run seed

## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

Once this project is opened in Visual Studio Code, or navigated to using Git Bash (or similar command-line tool), run: 

    npm start 

The root route for this application is `http://localhost:3001`, but you can change the port number in the `server.js` file.

Open up [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or similar program, and use the following routes to interact with the database:

- `http://localhost:3001/api/users`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtId`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/`
- `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId`
